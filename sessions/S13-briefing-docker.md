# S13 · ARM64 container

**System 02 · Research Briefing Agent**

**Goal.** Requirements copied before source so the install layer caches. Built natively for ARM64 — confirm the image architecture after the build. Image size recorded.

**Commit.** `build(research-agent): containerise service with ARM64 Dockerfile and layered dependency cache`

**Evidence.** `Build log with image size`

<summary><b>How to fill this in</b></summary>

<br>

Each entry answers four questions, in this order.

| Question | Field | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| **What did you try to do?** | `Goal` | Context for the session — pre-written above, do not rewrite it |
| **What actually happened?** | `What happened` · `The number` · `Blocker` | The result: success, failure, or partial |
| **What decision did you make?** | `Decision` · `Dead end` | The *why* behind the code — this is what you will need in an interview |
| **What is the next unknown?** | `Next` | Prevents cold-start anxiety next week |

**Five rules that keep it useful.**

1. **One session, one file.** A log of completed work, not a to-do list.
2. **Write it during or immediately after the session.** Memory decays inside a day.
3. **Paste the exact error.** Not "had a Docker problem" — the actual message. You will search for it again.
4. **Tag dead ends explicitly.** *"Tried Pinecone → too expensive at this stage, switched to Chroma."* This is what stops you re-entering the same rabbit hole in six weeks.
5. **Link the PR.** Set `pr:` in the frontmatter so a reader can trace the log to the diff.

**Every number carries its `n`.** A metric without a sample size is a decoration, and this log is
where the habit is enforced before the number reaches a README. No number this session? Write
"no number this session" — a blank reads as an omission, a sentence reads as a fact.

**Not here:** roadmap (→ Issues) · API docs (→ `README.md`) · how a number was produced
(→ `docs/METHODOLOGY.md`) · a decision's full record (→ `<system>/adr/`).
